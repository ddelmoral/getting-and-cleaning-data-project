Coursera getting and cleaning data final project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1 - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2 - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3 - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4 - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5 - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The data files should be downloaded and extracted in the default directory.
run_analysis.R should be placed in the parent folder above the UCI HAR Dataset.
Set the default directory to these folder.

Prerequisites:

The run_analysis.R script requires reshape2 and data.table libraries to run properly.
